okay, here's the plan. 

For the datbase, I want to have it set up like this:  

id/ description (replace with image eventually)/ clean/ type (top or bottom) (maybe eventually add shoes or hats)/fall?/Winter?/summer?/spring?/dress?/onepiece?

Here are the functionalities I want: 
1. generate_outfits
2. pick_new
3. wear_it
4. do laundry
5. wash_1
6. wear_1
7. declutter_1
8. suggest_5
9. declutter_all
10. add_item
11. add_tags
12. edit_tags
13. retake_photo
